##### Part 2 - GDB ##### 
  # Show basic C adding program
  as -gstabs -o SimpleDemo.o SimpleDemo.s
  ld -o SimpleDemo SimpleDemo.o
  ./SimpleDemo

  ps aux | grep SimpleDemo
  vim /proc/2335/maps

  Show the permissions these segments have with r-xp

  This shows virtual memory and where the process is assigned

  note the stack has moved to a different address
  in order to protect against attacks and buffer overlow attacks
  virtual address randomization was implemented as of the 2.6 linux kernel

  So everytime you run the program the stack will not be located in the same
  section to deter against exploits

  But we go about and look at this a different way by switching off the
  randomization
  vim /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

  #GDB
    gdb SimpleDemo
    run 10 20
 
    disassemble main
    #show the various memory locations in the process and show the instruction
    #which is in that location

    list 1
    breakpoint 8
    run 10 20
    print x
    print y
    print z
    info registers

    help x
    x lets you view and examine memory
    10 is a in hex
    20 is 14 in hex

    delete breakpoints
